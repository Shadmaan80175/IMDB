About This Project
This project is an interactive dashboard built in Power BI to analyze and visualize key performance metrics of the movie industry. The dashboard provides a high-level overview of film performance, with a specific focus on deep-diving into different genres.

Users can dynamically filter the entire report by selecting a genre (such as Action, Adventure, Comedy, etc.) to see how revenue, popularity, and production company performance change.

## Key Features
• Interactive Genre Slicers: The main feature of the dashboard is the ability to filter all visualizations by one or more genres.

• KPI Cards: At-a-glance metrics show the total revenue and total popularity for the selected genre(s).

• Comparative Analysis: A "Genres Revenue Distribution" donut chart shows the selected genre's share of total revenue compared to all other genres.

• Trend Analysis: A "Genres Popularity" line chart visualizes the historical popularity trend for the selected genre.

## Dashboard Visualizations
 The main report page includes a comprehensive set of visuals:

1. Profit of Production Companies: A bar chart that ranks production companies based on their total profit within the selected genre.

2. Top Movies Revenue & Popularity: A bar chart highlighting the top-performing individual movies, showing their revenue and popularity.

3. Production Companies Popularity: A pie chart that breaks down the market share of production companies based on their popularity score.

4. Key Metrics: Dedicated cards display the selected genre, its total revenue (e.g., "200bn"), and its total popularity score (e.g., "27K").

## Technology Used
Microsoft Power BI: Used for data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visualization.
